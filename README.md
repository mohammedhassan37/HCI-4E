# Interview 

<a id="q1"></a>
# 1. At what points during your shopping do you feel most uncertain or need more information (Qualitative: Identifies intervention opportunities) [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Looking at purchasing new products on the shelf which I have not previously seen before.   

R2: When I am unsure about location or types of products available for what I am looking for.  

R3: I think mostly when I’m standing in front of a shelf choosing between similar products and figuring out which brand to choose or which one is of better quality.  

R4: When buying new products or when a product I usually get is out of stock and I need to choose a different one.  

R5: When there’s too many options to pick from I feel a bit overstimulated picking which one to go for. 

R6: When im new to the store and don’t know my way around the correct aisle I would say I find it uncertain. 

R7: I feel most uncertain when comparing products and trying to decide what to buy. 

R8: I feel most uncertain when I’m not sure which product is more sustainable. 

R9: When trying a new product, e.g., checking dietary information about milk. 

R10: When pacing around the shop, e.g., when they can’t find the item they are looking for. 

R11: When the product’s packaging is unclear. 

R12: When the packaging is unclear or a bit vague about what makes it eco-friendly and stuff like that. 

R13: When products claim sustainability or eco friendliness. It’s vague. I don’t know what I’m supposed to trust. 

R14: When products claim a certain thing such as sugar free, but I don’t actually know if it’s true. 

R15: When I’m choosing between similar items and the packaging isn’t clear about where it’s from or what the sustainability claim actually means. 

R16: When I can’t find what I need quickly, or when I’m buying something new and I don’t know which brand is the best option. 

R17: I feel most uncertain when I’m buying packaged products like snacks, sauces, or ready meals. It’s hard to know if the ingredients are ethically sourced or if the packaging is recyclable. I also get confused when labels say things like “natural” or “eco-friendly” but don’t explain what that means. 

R18: When buying meat and fish. I’m never sure which labels mean high animal welfare. Also imported fruit, I don’t know how far it has travelled. 

<a id="q2"></a>
# 2. How often do you compare products for reasons other than price (e.g, health, ethics, sustainability)? (Quantitative: frequency measure)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Twice a week, or whenever I go shopping.  

R2: Never.  

R3: Sometimes when I go shopping so maybe once a week.  

R4: I quite often compare products based on health, as well as which packaging appeals more to me.  

R5: Recently, been on a healthy lifestyle so I have been comparing what’s more healthier a lot whenever I tend to go buy something. 

R6: I compare products based on the nutritional values and how much calories there are in protein. 

R7: I very rarely compare products for reasons other than price. If I do, it’s usually based on what I’d prefer to eat or drink at the time rather than quality or sustainability. 

R8: Only sometimes. I mostly compare for health reasons and occasionally for sustainability. 

R9: 2–3 times a month, while shopping once a week. 

R10: Quite often, mainly comparing brands of items. 

R11: I’m always comparing the nutritional information on products. 

R12: Pretty often to be honest. I always check the nutrition stuff, and sometimes I’ll look at where it’s made or if it’s ethically sourced as well. 

R13: Not often. I just stick to products I have been using regularly. 

R14: Sometimes. 5/10 times. 

R15: Most shopping trips are around 2–3 times a week.  

R16: Not much—maybe 1 in 5 trips and usually for nutrition rather than sustainability. 

R17: Maybe occasionally. Usually if it’s something like eggs, but if I’m in a rush, I’ll just grab the cheaper one. 

R18: Very often, I usually look at the health information. 

<a id="q3"></a>
# 3. Tell me about a recent moment when you tried to shop sustainably. What happened? (Qualitative: real-world behaviour)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: I placed an online order with a company that sources its food from local farms, I was very disappointed when food was delivered, as the cabbage had started to go off.   

R2: I don't think I have ever gone shopping with just sustainably in mind.  

R3: Honestly, I don’t try to shop sustainably that much.   

R4: I have never really tried to shop sustainably because there is no clear information about it on the product, so I usually just buy whatever I need.  

R5: I wasn’t really a sustainable shopper before, but now I pay more attention to the packaging and ethical sourcing. If something comes from an unethical source, I say no to that product. 

R6: I’m not really usually a sustainable shopper, but when I tend to be sustainable I try to go for products that are sourced locally around the UK. 

R7: I don’t think I ever shop sustainably. The last time I remember was after learning about Fairtrade in GCSE geography, when I bought a Fairtrade chocolate bar on the way home. 

R8: I once tried to buy eco-friendly products, but there wasn’t enough information, so I chose the one with less packaging. 

R9: Trying to shop for almond milk. 

R10: Decided to buy bananas in loose bunches instead of packaged bananas. 

R11: I haven’t done that recently. 

R12: I haven’t really made a big effort recently, unless there was an obvious better option. 

R13: I tried to buy better coffee but ended up choosing the one I recognized. 

R14: Tried to pick locally sourced fruits and vegetables. But some fruits cannot be grown locally so have to be imported, leaving me with no choice. 

R15: I tried to buy eggs with better welfare/lower impact, but I didn’t know which label was genuinely better, so I picked the one I recognised. 

R16: I didn’t plan to shop sustainably, but I chose the option with less packaging because it felt like the obvious better choice. 

R17: Last week I tried to buy more plant-based meals. I compared two brands of oat milk because one said it had lower carbon emissions. But I wasn’t sure if that was verified or just marketing. I ended up choosing the cheaper one because I didn’t feel confident about the claim. 

R18: Recently I was buying chicken and wasn’t sure which label meant better animal welfare. One pack said, “RSPCA Assured,” another said, “British farmed,” and another was organic but much more expensive. I wasn’t clear what the real differences were in terms of welfare or environmental impact. I ended up standing there reading the packaging for a few minutes and still felt unsure, so I chose the mid-priced one and hoped it was a reasonable compromise. 

<a id="q4"></a>
# 4. When you think you've made a sustainable choice, what information usually helps you feel confident? (Qualitative: mental models)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: If product included certain words such as organic, as it makes me feel that it was ethically grown.    

R2: Seeing a recycling badge on the packaging would be the main one.  

R3: Usually labels such as the Fairtrade one.  

R4: Searching online, seeing information on the package or reading customer reviews.  

R5: Eco friendly packing, when something is recyclable, it makes me feel good that it’s not going to waste because of global warming. 

R6: I mainly check if its not sourced abroad as for me carbon footprints is a big factor when I shop sustainable. 

R7: If I make a sustainable choice, I usually just trust what the packaging and labels say, or I look online to verify their claims. 

R8: Recycling and packaging information help me feel confident in a sustainable choice. 

R9: Certain symbols or branding, e.g., Fairtrade. 

R10: How much packaging is used, and the type of material used for the packaging. 

R11: Seeing the materials used on the packaging. 

R12: When it’s clearly labelled and it’s recyclable. 

R13: An official score. Probably from 1-10. 

R14: Reliable claims like it being locally sourced or some sort of clear sustainability claim. 

R15: Recognisable certifications plus country of origin and a short explanation of why it’s better. 

R16: A simple rating or clear recyclable packaging label. 

R17: Clear certifications, like Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance. Also, carbon footprint labels if they’re simple and easy to understand. 

R18: Independent verification. If the app cited credible sources or showed lifecycle impact data, I’d trust it more. 

<a id="q5"></a>
# 5. Imagine you're in a supermarket right now - what would make you reach for your phone to check sustainability information? (Qualitative: triggers for app use)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: If I had two products the same, different brands, similar price, and I just felt that I wanted to compare the two to see which was more sustainable (e.g if product was grown in UK, not an import).  

R2: If the product was a cheaper option, or not too much more expensive as others of the same product.  

R3: If I had similar products and I wanted to decide which one to buy based on sustainability.  

R4: If there is no clear information on the packaging and I am unsure whether the product is sustainable or not.  

R5: Everything, basically, if the packaging doesn’t clearly show that it’s sustainable or ethically sourced, I’d want to double-check before buying it. 

R6: I would probably say if I see labels like eco friendly or natural id want to double check what that really means, id also check my phone if im choosing between two similar products they cost about the same. 

R7: I would reach for my phone if I had more time while shopping and if sustainable products were cheaper. 

R8: I’d reach for my phone when comparing two products to see which is more eco-friendly. 

R9: Current world political events, e.g., wars. 

R10: To check if resources are ethically sourced, and information about the company, e.g., how much they pay their workers. 

R11: When there are two similar products and I’m not sure about which one to pick. 

R12: If I’m stuck between two similar products and they’re basically the same price, I’d probably grab my phone to see which one is more sustainable. 

R13: If two products are similar price and I can’t decide. Or maybe the product I usually get is out of stock and I need an alternative. 

R14: If I’m trying to find a sustainable option but can’t find it because sometimes products don’t have a clear sustainability claim on the packaging 

R15: If two products are similar price and I want to quickly see which is more sustainable, or if my usual item is out of stock and I need the best alternative. 

R16: If it’s fast and helps me decide without slowing down — especially if it shows price differences and the sustainable option isn’t much more expensive. 

R17: If I saw two similar products and one claimed to be eco-friendly but didn’t explain why. Or if it was a more expensive sustainable option and I wanted to check if it’s better. 

R18: If I saw a sustainability claim I didn’t recognise. Or if I was making a bulk purchase and wanted to feel responsible about it. 

<a id="q6"></a>
# 6. If this app disappeared tomorrow, how much would it impact your ability to shop sustainably? (Quantitative: perceived usefulness)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Yes it would, as the app provides quick information from one source instead of having to go on the internet and search individually.  

R2: It would not really affect me too much as I do not normally go shopping with sustainability in mind.  

R3: A lot because I don’t think products alone have enough information about sustainability on their packaging and researching would take some time.  

R4: Greatly, because not many packages have clear information about sustainability.    

R5: It would impact me drastically as I would it every day or would like to use it almost every day as it would be crucial to me. 

R6: It would impact me massively because without the app I wouldn’t really have a clue of where to start on or how sustainable the products are in the supermarket. So I would say I would rely a lot on the app when shopping. 

R7: It wouldn’t impact me much because I don’t shop sustainably anyway. 

R8: It would make my shopping slower because I wouldn’t get quick sustainability information. 

R9: Since I don’t use the app much, it wouldn’t affect my ability to shop sustainably. 

R10: It would inconvenience me a bit, as I couldn’t look up grocery items quickly. 

R11: It would significantly reduce it because I wouldn’t have such information about the products. 

R12: It would probably affect me quite a lot, without the app I’d just guess most of the time. 

R13: The app would help. But surely wouldn’t become a necessity. 

R14: Probably a lot, since it would make finding sustainable products 10x easier and faster. 

R15: Quite a lot. I'd still try, but I’d probably default to familiar brands because it would take longer to check. 

R16: Not much. I wouldn’t rely on it unless it also makes shopping faster/easier. 

R17: Probably a moderate impact, although I do care, without easy access to information I’d probably default to price and convenience.   

R18: High impact, but I would still try and shop sustainably. 

<a id="q7"></a>
# 7. When you scan a product, what is the first thing you expect the app to show you, and why? (Qualitative: priority information)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Country of origin that the product was manufactured or grown, as I would like to support manufacturers or farmers in the UK.  

R2: The price of the product so that I know it is cheaper than alternatives and it falls within my budget.  

R3: A simple red/green/amber rating on the sustainability of the product.  

R4: A rating on how sustainable a product is, so if I am shopping quickly, I can immediately check.    

R5: When I scan a product, the first thing I expect the app to show is a rating and its health score. This is because I want to quickly know how good it is without having to look into all the details. If the rating is low, then I would check more information to understand why it’s bad. If the rating is good, I would feel confident and add it to my cart. 

R6: I would probably say the nutritional value of the product and also the ingredients used and where it comes from. 

R7: The first thing I’d expect the app to show is the price, because that’s the most important factor in deciding what to buy. 

R8: I’d expect to see a sustainability rating out of 5 first, so I can quickly judge the product. 

R9: Price, dietary intake, protein, calories, etc. 

R10: Calorie intake, healthiness of the food, allergens, etc. 

R11: The materials and the sourcing of the products. 

R12: First thing I’d want to see is what’s it made of and where it came from. 

R13: An easy-to-read rating. 

R14: Probably some sort of sustainability claim or how it ranks in terms of sustainability. 

R15: A clear eco-score (colour + number) and the top 1–2 reasons, so I can decide quickly. 

R16: Price first and then the best alternatives, with a simple eco rating — price decides the purchase for me. 

R17: A simple sustainability score, because I don’t want to read a lot of text.  

R18: A breakdown of carbon footprint, animal welfare rating and package recyclability. 

<a id="q8"></a>
# 8. How would you prefer sustainability information to be presented - visually, numerically, textually or a mix? (Qualitative + Quantitative: preference strength)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Mix of visual and numbers. (e.g., map where product was manufactured)  

R2: Mostly textually.  

R3: I think visually or numerically would be good, like a score out of ten.  

R4: Numerical to quickly see the score and textually so I can understand why the product received that rating.    

R5: I would say mainly Visually and numerically, I like knowing percentages. 

R6: I’ll say like a bit of everything would be more important to show compared to just one part of it because showing it only numerically wouldn’t really show if its sustainable enough or better than other products as you would be limiting yourself. 

R7: I’d prefer sustainability information to be presented as a mix — text explaining claims, data to back it up, and possibly diagrams. 

R8: I prefer sustainability information presented as a mix. 

R9: A mix of text and visually. 

R10: A mix of numerically and visually. 

R11: A mix, but mainly numerically. 

R12: I’d like a clear score or colour indicator first, then a short explanation underneath if I want more detail. 

R13: Should be visual enough that you can look at it with once glance and continue shopping. 

R14: Mix. 

R15: Score first, then short text, then details if I tap. 

R16: Mostly visual with very short text. I don’t want long explanations while shopping. 

R17: A mix preferably. I would like a visual score, quick bullet points and an option to expand with more details. Too much text would overwhelm me. 

R18: Layered information. A summary score at the top, detailed data below and a graph for impact comparisons. 

<a id="q9"></a>
# 9. What emotional reactions do you experience when trying to shop sustainably (e.g, guilt, pride, frustration)? (Quantitative: behaviour-change likelihood)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Mostly guilt if it comes down to the price which results in not purchasing sustainably.  

R2: Boredom, as I would rather just crack on and get the shopping done.  

R3: Probably guilt because I know it’s not something I often try to do, though I should.  

R4: Frustration because I like to shop quickly and not all packaging has the information I need. I either end up not buying sustainable products or have to research before going to the store which takes time.  

R5: When im buying something from an unethical background, I do feel guilt, and then when I know im boycotting that product I do feel pride. 

R6: When I try to shop sustainably, I usually feel a mix of emotions. Sometimes I feel proud, especially when I choose something that I know is better for the environment, like a product with less plastic or from a responsible brand. But I also feel frustrated quite often. It can be hard to know what’s actually sustainable, and the information isn’t always clear. 

R7: I feel frustrated when products I want aren’t in stock or when I can’t check information due to no signal. 

R8: Sometimes I feel proud for choosing eco-friendly products. 

R9: Surprise at different products using more or less sustainable resources. 

R10: Depending on the company’s working conditions and information about the company, could feel guilty. 

R11: Usually guilt if I fail to do so. 

R12: Sometimes guilt and a bit of frustration when it’s hard to tell what the right choice is. 

R13: Sometimes it just feels tiring trying to find sustainable products. 

R14: Emotions don’t play a part in shopping. But if I had to say probably frustration if I couldn’t find a correct sustainable product if I wanted to. 

R15: Frustration when it’s unclear and guilt when price pushes me to the less sustainable option. 

R16: Boredom or annoyance if it adds extra steps. I want to finish shopping quickly. 

R17: Guilt if I choose the cheaper, less sustainable option. Frustration when I can’t find clear information. Pride when I feel like I made a “good” choice. 

R18: Concern about climate change. Responsibility toward my children. 

<a id="q10"></a>
# 10. How likely are you to change your shopping habits if the app showed your long-term environmental impact? (Quantitative: behavioural-change likelihood)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: That could sway me and make a difference to my habits. I would say that it would likely sway me if there were stats about the difference it could make.  

R2: I would be slightly more likely to change my habits based off this information.  

R3: Pretty likely, if I knew my shopping habits were negatively impacting the environment then I would try to change that.  

R4: Very likely because seeing the environmental impact would show me how much damage I am causing which I would not want to continue to do.    

R5: If needed to change my habits, I would for the environment and sustainability.  

R6: Most likely because let’s say if the products I usually get is very bad for the environment long term, I wouldn’t get it again and would stick to an alternative product that’s got a lesser environmental impact. 

R7: I’d be quite likely to change my habits if the app showed long-term environmental impact. 

R8: It would likely change my habits a lot and encourage me to choose more sustainable products. 

R9: If the app shows the environmental impact, I’d be more likely to change my shopping habits. 

R10: More likely to change my shopping habits, feeling a greater responsibility after seeing the environmental impact. 

R11: Very likely because it would make me feel responsible. 

R12: Quite likely if it shows the impact of my choices. 

R13: Probably a 50 50 chance. 

R14: Likely. 

R15: Likely — especially if it shows meaningful differences over time. 

R16: Slightly likely, but only if it’s simple and doesn’t mean paying loads more. 

R17: Quite likely. If I could see “Your choices saved X kg of CO₂ this month,” that would motivate me. 

R18: Very high. If the app tracked long-term impact trends over time, I’d adjust purchasing patterns. 

<a id="q11"></a>
# 11. How do you feel about sustainability being a social or competitive activity? (Qualitative: attitudes toward gamification)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: I don't see it as being competitive, however I see it as a social activity.  

R2: It would be a nice idea, but not necessarily realistic as I don't think the majority of people would have the time to think about this while shopping.  

R3: I think it being a social activity could work, maybe people can collect points for being sustainable which will give the user some sort of reward.  

R4: I think it would be good motivation.  

R5: I feel like more people should be socially aware of our environment and taking more care about it to preserve and last longer. 

R6: I would say its more of a social activity because at the end of the day, I’m buying products and I’m making that conscious choice of the products I buy and whether they can have an impact on the environment or not. 

R7: I think sustainability as a social or competitive activity is a good idea, especially if there are rewards. 

R8: Sustainability being social or competitive could motivate me. 

R9: Think it would be a net benefit. 

R10: Think it would be a benefit as a motivator for users to improve their sustainability. 

R11: I think it would be beneficial if there was a leaderboard or something. 

R12: I think a light social element could be good, like seeing how you compare with friends without it feeling too serious. 

R13: It doesn’t feel like a matter to compete over. Sustainability is a greater goal and cannot be achieved through one person alone. Rather it should be done collectively. 

R14: I think adding a competitive activity would increase engagement and impact of each person towards sustainability. 

R15: More social/collaborative than competitive — it feels like a shared goal. 

R16: Competition could work if it’s lightweight and has rewards—otherwise I probably wouldn’t care. 

R17: I’m not really into competition. It might make me anxious. I’d prefer something more collaborative. 

R18: Friendly competition could work, especially between families. But it shouldn’t feel like public shaming. 

<a id="q12"></a>
# 12. What type of social features would motivate you - collaboration, competition, sharing achievements, or none. (Qualitative + Quantitative: preference strength)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Collaboration and working together, I think.   

R2: Competition would be the most motivating for me.  

R3: I think something like sharing achievements or collaborative goals could be nice.  

R4: Competition would motivate me and make me use the app more.  

R5: I would say like reward points because I love competition and enjoy winning things. 

R6: I think collaboration and sharing achievements would motivate me the most. This is because I like the idea of working towards a common goal, like a group challenge to reduce plastic use or lower carbon footprint. It feels more positive and supportive. 

R7: Competition and a reward system would motivate me. 

R8: Sharing achievements would motivate me. 

R9: Competition and reward-based activities, as more people would be inclined to use the app. 

R10: Competition and collaboration — competition to motivate users and collaboration for achievements when shopping sustainably. 

R11: Competition to encourage myself and others around me to do better. 

R12: Friendly competitions would motivate me more than just sharing achievements. 

R13: Shared challenges or community quotas.   

R14: Sharing achievements and competition. 

R15: Collaboration and sharing achievements with close friends. 

R16: Competition plus rewards (points + vouchers). 

R17: Sharing achievements occasionally, maybe small rewards and not leaderboards 

R18: Monthly sustainability reports, family challenges and achievements. Not public leaderboards. 

<a id="q13"></a>
# 13. What personal needs or preferences should the app adapt to, in order to support you better? (Qualitative: accessibility + personalisation)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: Bigger font, light mode. Speech to text/text to speech as this would make it feel more personalised.  

R2: Light mode/dark mode, dark and easy to read text.  

R3: Dark mode would definitely be nice.  

R4: Different budget options so it can suggest affordable sustainable alternatives.    

R5: You could put like what type of households you are from like if you are a single student or a family of four like it will change depending on preferences and affordability. 

R6: I would say definitely more friendly features that are more easy to understand and play around and maybe tracking your daily shopping products. 

R7: I’d like personalised recommendations and the ability to use the app offline. 

R8: The app should be fast, responsive, and personalised to products I buy often. 

R9: The app should track normal shopping habits and give feedback based on sustainability. 

R10: Allow the user to pick goals that the app would then help achieve, e.g., a health goal to suggest healthier food options. 

R11: If anyone has needs for accessibility features like colour blindness and stuff like that. 

R12: It should let you adjust based on what matters most to you, like focusing more on packaging, carbon impact, or ethics, plus basic accessibility options. 

R13: For me, Budget is the most important. But maybe it can let the user choose. 

R14: Learn buying habits to help improve buying habits such as suggest better diet. 

R15: Budget settings, fast scanning, dark mode, larger text, and eco-scoring. 

R16: Speed, offline/low-signal mode and personalisation based on what I usually buy. 

R17: Student budget. Dietary preferences (vegetarian). Time constraints, I don’t want to spend ages scanning things. 

R18: Family-sized shopping. Time efficiency. Allergy filtering. 

<a id="q14"></a>
# 14. If you could design one feature that would make sustainable shopping effortless, what would it be? (Qualitative: innovation insight)  [Back to Top](#top)

R1: If you were in a shop and were on a budget of, say 50 pounds, you could enter this in the app, and it would provide you products that fit within that price range and match the criteria set that you have provided. And provide you with location within the shop (e.g. aisle). 

R2: Categories of products such as fruit, dairy, condiments and the cheapest options within those categories that are available.  

R3: Something automatic, as in I would be able to scan a product and it will automatically give me an alternative which is better for the environment.  

R4: The app immediately showing a better alternative after I scan a product so I can easily swap it out. Also, a colour rating system would make it quick to understand.  

R5: Make it look simpler and user friendly so its easier to navigate around. 

R6: I’d say like that data side of things so like really diving into which products are the most impactful for the environment and which are not. 

R7: A feature that shows all sustainability information at once and justifies why I should pay more for sustainable options. 

R8: A barcode scanner that instantly shows the best eco-friendly option. 

R9: Tasks to complete every shopping trip that would make the shopping more sustainable. 

R10: A scanner that instantly provides detailed sustainability information about an item. 

R11: A rating system to show how good a product is. 

R12: A simple overall rating out of five or something, so I can decide fast without wasting time. 

R13: Just tell me the best option straight away. 

R14: QR scanning to see products. 

R15: After scanning, instantly show the best swap in the same store, with aisle/location and a “within £X of budget” filter.
